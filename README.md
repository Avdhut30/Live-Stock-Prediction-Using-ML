__US Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning__


**Overview**


This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting US stock prices using a model trained on live data obtained from a website. The prediction is based on the historical values of the stock over the last 30 days.


**Features**


Live Data Integration: The project fetches live stock data from a specified website to ensure real-time information is used for predictions.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a robust machine learning model to analyze the historical stock prices and make predictions.
30-Day Historical Data: The model considers the past 30 days' stock values to capture recent trends and patterns.
Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

**Python 3.x**


Required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.
